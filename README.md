# üè´ StudyMe
StudyMe is a desktop application, course management system (CMS) desinged to make it easy for course centers to synchronize their students with their courses. This app was made as project for college and is my first ever functional application. This project was made using Visual Studio 2022 and C#.

## ‚öô Technologies used:
- Visual Studio 2022
- C#
- SQL
- MySQL Database

## üíª How To  Use:

### Installation
As of now, this project doesn't have a setup and remains as a Visual Studio project so you'll need to download and install Visual Studio from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).  
  
Additionally, you may need to install the [Century Gothic](https://www.dafontfree.io/century-gothic-font-free/) font for the UI to display correctly.


### Adjust the Database
Put the folder named StudyMe on the root of your C drive. (To ensure the database works I set it up this way) 

### Login
When you first run the program, you can login either as an admin or as a user. An admin is the one who allows you to access the program by giving you a username and a password specific to you.

#### Admin Login Credentials:
Username: *admin*  
Password: *admin*  

From here you can add a new user or you can just go back to the login page and enter any existing user's credentials as shown in the table.

***Note:*** *login information is case sensitive so be sure you're entering it correctly. The login screen has a **CAPS LOCK** notification to alarm you if caps lock is active or not.*

After entering a valid username and passowrd you will be greeted with a welcome page and a side bar by which you can access the other pages by clicking on the corresponding button. You can also choose to log out and enter as another user. You'll see the name change at the top right of the app window to the current signed in user.

The buttons can be expanded to reveal further functionalities.
